# Sherlock

Sherlock tracks the person's followers and reports on follow/unfollow activities. This is a private app. The code will be open source and anyone with a valid access token can use this for their personal use.

To get started,

 - Sign up for a [Twitter developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html)
 - Create a Twitter app under that dev account
 - Set up below environment variables correspondingly

    ```bash
    export SHERLOCK_TWITTER__ACCESS__TOKEN=""
    export SHERLOCK_TWITTER__ACCESS__TOKEN__SECRET=""
    export SHERLOCK_TWITTER__CONSUMER__KEY=""
    export SHERLOCK_TWITTER__CONSUMER__SECRET=""
    ```
